MAIN GOAL: Flesh out ideas for the private sample library feature

Should probably define what the private sample library is.

I want to be able to host my private Splice library in a Cloudflare R2 bucket and access it all as remote samples.

That's pretty much it.  There will probably be a need for some more advanced search functionality or stuff like that in the future, but that can be considered to be a separate future feature.

Currently, we get the list of all remote samples from the backend via an API call.  I think that I want to keep that as it is and expand on that from here.  I think that trying to build a ton of custom stuff in the UI that will have some kind of local state or special casing.

So at this point, I think we may need to pivot into a user/login system.  Would be good to keep it as minimal and unintrusive as possible.  It will be entirely optional to start with and shouldn't even show up in the UI by default.

The login system will be used for two things then:

 * Preset sharing
 * Custom remote sample libraries

I've been wanting to add in this login system for a long time now anyway.  I think it will be important to enable OAuth logins with other applications like Google and Github at least.
