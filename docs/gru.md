# GRU

A **Gated Recurrence Unit** is a component that can be used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that add memory.  This is useful for [[vocal-synthesis]] and other tasks that involve repeated time-steps since there is always a lot of dependence on previous time-steps in periodic data like waveforms.
