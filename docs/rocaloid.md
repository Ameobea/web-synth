# rocaloid

**Rocaloid** is an open source [[vocal-synthesis]] project created by [[sleepwalking]], heavily inspired by [[vocaloid]] and [[utau]].  Main source code on Github: <https://github.com/Rocaloid>

This project is definitely obsolete and 6-7 years since last updated at the time of writing.  It seems to have been created by [[sleepwalking]] and others during his time at university.

Whitepaper-type thing going over design, goals, infrastructure, and some history: <https://rocaloid.github.io/resources/publications/Introduction-20140614.pdf>

Sleepwalking has a recorded TED talk video going over his learning + experiences building this software: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb_kHCtudMk>
