# htsvoice

**htsvoice** files are voice models produced and used by the [[HTS]] [[vocal-synthesis]] framework.  They are generated by training tagged input audio from a speaker/singer and can be used with HTS and tools built on top of it to generate speech or singing waveforms.

## some free htsvoice files I've found

* <https://github.com/icn-lab/htsvoice-tohoku-f01>
* MMDAgent, a (partially?) open source virtual agent with audio and visual synthesis.  Contains the open source "Mei" htsvoice model: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mmdagent/files/MMDAgent/MMDAgent-1.7/MMDAgent-1.7.zip/download>

## random links and resources

## comparison to other voicebank formats

HTS voices are models that are trained, which according to someone on the [[utau]] forums requires "around 4 hours of english recordings to do a decent HMM voice"
