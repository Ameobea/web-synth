# operator

**Operators** are the primary sources of sound for the [[fm-synthesizer]].  Usually, each operator is an oscillator that produces sound just like a [[traditional-oscillator-based-synthesizer]].  However, the basis of FM synthesis comes from the fact that operators _modulate_ the frequency of other operators.  By configuring the amounts and routing of operators' modulation via the [[modulation-matrix]] and varying the amounts of modulation over time, a huge variety of different sounds and timbres can be produced.
