# discord

**Discord** is a widely used voice + text chat application.  It's omnipresent in modern online communities.

Their voice chat makes use of [[opus]] for encoding/decoding.  This is evident since they don't seem to be stripping their binaries, at least not on Linux.  Using `perf` on the Discord process, it's possible to see several opus functions in the trace:

Some of them, such as `opus_fft_impl`, are used in other projects that use Opus code.  The one I know I've seen it in before is [[rnnoise]], see the code directly: ![](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise/blob/1cbdbcf1283499bbb2230a6b0f126eb9b236defd/src/kiss_fft.c#L518).

I get a kick out of the fact that the license for some of that Opus code that was compiled into Discord is licensed "Copyright (c) 2006-2011, Skype Limited": <https://github.com/xiph/opus/blob/7b05f44f4baadf34d8d1073f4ff69f1806d5cdb4/silk/NLSF_del_dec_quant.c#L2>
