# digital audio workstation

A **digital audio workstation** or DAW is a piece of software for music production with the main goal of creating tracks and audio files as output.  There are many options available in this space such as Ableton Live, FL Studio, Bitwig, LMMS, and many others.  Some are free, some are very expensive, and some offer "light" versions with reduced features for a reduced price.

Web synth itself **is not a DAW**, although it does support some DAW-like features and workflows.  Instead, web synth consists of a connected set of [[module]]s, each which can function independently to synthesize, process, analyze, or visualize sound as well as connect to each other in the [[audio-graph]].  I've been describing it as something along the lines of an "audio synthesis/DSP experimentation environment".
