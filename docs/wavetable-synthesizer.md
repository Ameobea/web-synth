# wavetable synthesizer

The [[wavetable-synthesizer]] is a web synth [[module]] that creates sound using [[wavetable]] synthesis.  It supports loading wavetables (custom wavetable support coming soon), interpolating between them via modulatable params, and outputting audio.

It is integrated into the [[synth-designer]] as well as being available as a [[patch-network]] node directly.  The synth designer integration currently only supports monophonic sound output, but I plan to make this properly polyphonic soon.
