# rnn

**RNN** stands for **Recurrent Neural Network**.  It's a powerful evolution of neural networks that facilitates the processing of sequential data such as audio or timeseries.  This makes it a very popular choice for many ML-powered audio applications such as [[noise-suppression]], [[vocal-synthesis]], and more.

Some projects that make use of RNNs:

 * [[WaveRNN]]
 * [[cevio-ai]]
 * [[amazon-chime]]
 * [[rnnoise]]
 * [[synthesizer-v]]
