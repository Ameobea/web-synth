# cheaptrick

**Cheaptrick** is "a [[spectral-envelope]] estimator for high-quality speech synthesis".  It is used by the [[world-vocoder]].

Research paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639314000697

Judging by the research paper, it performs better than two other spectral envelope estimators that they compared it to.

## source code analysis

Main source code: <https://github.com/mmorise/World/blob/master/src/cheaptrick.cpp>

Source seems pretty readable.  I think it was ported over from Matlab, but doesn't seem to be an issue.

It looks to be doing both FFT and inverse FFT.  It has mention of [[cepstrum]].
