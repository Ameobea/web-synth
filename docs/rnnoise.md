# rnnoise

**rnnoise** is a "Recurrent neural network for audio noise reduction".  Its main contributor is [[jmvalin]] who has done a good bit of other work in this space including working on [[amazon-chime]] and contributing to [[LPCNet]].  It also shares some code with [[opus]] which makes sense since [[jmvalin]] is active with that project as well.

Code: <https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise>

As its name suggests, it uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with [[GRU]]s internally.  It really has a lot of similarities with the noise suppression used by [[amazon-chime]] and I highly suggest reading an exellent writeup by [[jmvalin]] to understand RNNoise better even though they're different projects since they share so much functionality: <https://www.amazon.science/blog/how-amazon-chimes-challenge-winning-noise-cancellation-works>
