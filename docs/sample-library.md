# sample-library

![](https://ameo.link/u/8xl.png)

There's not much here right now, but the **sample library** is a [[module]] that displays all available samples for the application, lets them be previewed/listened to, and allows for samples to be loaded in from either the local filesystem or remote server.  It is a frontend to the [[sample-manager]], which serves as the internal interface for interacting with samples in the application.

In addition to being a top-level [[module]], the sample library also has a React component that can be dropped into other modules and components for sample selection purposes.  For example, the [[sequencer]] uses that component to allow users to pick samples to be played by it.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[module]: module "web synth modules"
[sample-manager]: sample-manager "sample-manager"
[sequencer]: sequencer "sequencer"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
