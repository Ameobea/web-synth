Planning notes for the MIDI editor CV outputs.

MAIN GOAL: Plan out work on the MIDI editor control voltage modulation feature

 * Going to be embedded into the MIDI Editor
   * Going to add outputs to the MIDI editor that will be CV corresponding to the output of the envelope
 * Integration into the whole global start/stop system so that it's synced to the MIDI output and other playback

## Integration

 * Will be some way to add bars at the bottom of the MIDI editor so that we can add and remove them dynamically
 * Probably click some button to add them in

## Backend

 * Will probably re-use the existing ADSR2 envelope generator for the backend, just with a different UI

---

Two main remaining tasks:

 * Actually implement the backend support so it generates output sync'd to the global playback state
 * Build the UI for it

## UI

 * Add boxes to the bottom of the MIDI editor which will house the CV outputs and have the envelope editor
 * Should be collapsable so that we can hide them if we're not using them atm
 * Should have controls to change name, delete, change output range, etc.
