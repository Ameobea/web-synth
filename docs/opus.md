# opus

**Opus** is an audio codec.  It is widely used for a variety of different purposes.  It has some advanced features such as extremely efficient encoding of speech.  It in many ways is the evolution of [[speex]].  [[jmvalin]] contributed greatly to it and uses code from it in other projects he's worked on such as [[speex]], [[rnnoise]], and [[lpcnet]].
