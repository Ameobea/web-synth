# faust

**Faust** is a functional programming language designed specifically for digital signal processing.  It is an older language developed in academia and supports a functional design and support for a huge variety of platforms from microcontrollers to the web browser via WebAudio + WebAssembly.

Faust is well-known in the digital signal processing world, and many open-source programs exist that can be dropped directly into web-synth with zero porting required.  For example, I've used this [model of the Buchla 259 wavefolder](https://github.com/yorgoszachos/b259wf) in web-synth directly and it works like a charm with no modifications necessary.

## license

It is [licensed](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/blob/master-dev/COPYING.txt) GPLv2, but iirc there are some exemptions for certain things.  In particular, I know that the [Faust standard library](https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/) is licensed LGPL but has a condition such that it can be used outside o LGPL context:

```
EXCEPTION TO THE LGPL LICENSE : As a special exception, you may create a
larger FAUST program which directly or indirectly imports this library
file and still distribute the compiled code generated by the FAUST
compiler, or a modified version of this compiled code, under your own
copyright and license.
```

## web synth integration

Faust is integrated directly into web synth via the [[code-editor]].
