**Filters** are audio processing constructs that change the levels different frequency components of a sound.  Going into the details of how filters work is out of scope of this guide, but the filters used in web-synth are mostly simple.

The filters for the [[fm-synth]] and [[synth-designer]] are both currently based off of [[web-audio]]'s [`BiquadFilterNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode).  The controls of the filter module consist of the standard parameters for a [biquad filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter) and an [[envelope-generator]] that can be used to set how the filter's cutoff changes over time.  The `adsr length ms` parameter controls how long the envelope is in milliseconds and the [[envelope-generator]] beneath it allows configuration of exactly how the frequency changes over time.

## filter designer

Web synth includes a [[filter-designer]] [[module]] which allows composing multiple biquad filters together and viewing the resulting [[frequency-response]] in a plot.  It can be connected via the [[patch-network]] to other modules or nodes and used to process sound.

## bypass

By checking the **bypass** checkbox, the filter will be bypassed completely and sound will pass through as if the filter doesn't exist.
