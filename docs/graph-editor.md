# graph editor

The **graph editor** is the primary interface to the [[audio-graph]] that forms the backbone of web-synth.  It enders a direct view of the graph showing all nodes, their inputs and outputs, and the connections between them.  It allows users to connect, disconnect, create, and delete nodes at will.

Currently, the graph editor shows a complete view of the full audio graph for an entire instance of web synth.  However, plans exist to create subgraphs where smaller pieces of the audio graph can be built in isolation and then connected to each other at a higher level.
