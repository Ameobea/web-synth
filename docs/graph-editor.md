# graph editor

The **graph editor** is the primary interface to the [[audio-graph]] that forms the backbone of web-synth.  It renders a direct view of the graph showing all nodes, their inputs and outputs, and the connections between them.  It allows users to connect, disconnect, create, and delete nodes at will.

## small view

When a node is selected, a minimal UI for controlling it isrendered on the right side of the graph editor.  This UI region is referred to as the [[small-view]].

Not all nodes have a small view and are configured by clicking on their applicable tab on the top of the application.  However, for other simpler nodes like the [[scale-and-shift]] node, they only have a small view and the only way of interacting with them is through the graph editor.

## subgraph support

Currently, the graph editor shows a complete view of the full audio graph for an entire instance of web synth.  However, plans exist to create subgraphs where smaller pieces of the audio graph can be built in isolation and then connected to each other at a higher level.

[audio-graph]: audio-graph "audio graph"
[small-view]: small-view "small-view"
[scale-and-shift]: scale-and-shift "scale and shift"
