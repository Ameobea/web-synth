# scale and shift

Scale and shift is a node in the [[graph-editor]] that facilitates scaling + shifting signals from an input range to an output range.  The equation is: `out = in * scale + shift`

Unlike things like Eurorack, web synth doesn't normalize its signals to a single range of values (Eurorack uses one volt per octave for a lot of things).  Instead, various components/modules output values in ranges applicable to them.

## Linear <-> Exponential Conversion

The scale and shift node also supports converting value to/from linear/exponential/logarithmic scales.  This is useful for doing things like mapping a linear input value from something like a [[lfo-node]] or a UI slider into an output range appropriate for controlling a filter cutoff frequency or similar.

To enable this, toggle on the "convert linear/exponential" checkbox in the scale and shift node's [[small-view]].  That will enable the UI for configuring the mapping.

It includes a slider for configuring the steepness of the output curve as well as a small line plot showing the mapping of the full input range into the output range.](https://i.ameo.link/bsi.png)
