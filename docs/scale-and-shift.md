# scale and shift

Scale and shift is a node in the [[graph-editor]] that facilitates scaling + shifting signals from an input range to an output range.  The equation is: `out = in * scale + shift`

Unlike things like Eurorack, web synth doesn't normalize its signals to a single range of values (Eurorack uses one volt per octave for a lot of things).  Instead, various components/modules output values in ranges applicable to them.
