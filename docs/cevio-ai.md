# cevio ai

**CeVIO AI** is a [[vocal-synthesis]] tool made by CeVIO that supports singing synthesis as well as [[tts]].  It is quite new with a release date of Jan 29, 2021.  It uses a [[rnn]]-based architecture which is also used by [[synthesizer-v]] and other modern vocal synthesis tools.  It was developed in cooperation with the Nagoya Institute of Technology which has worked on other vocal synthesis tools in the past such as [[sinsy]].

Along with most other singing synthesis tools out there, there are several different voice banks that can be switched between.

Here's a really nice song that stood out to me when I heard it because I wasn't familiar with CeVIO AI at the time: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqKbuEDvaf8&list=RDyzF1LVly7Jw>  It features the [KAFU](https://cevio.fandom.com/wiki/KAFU) voicebank.
