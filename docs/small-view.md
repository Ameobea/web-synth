# small-view

The small view is the minimal UI rendered on the right side of the [[graph-editor]] when nodes are selected.  The screenshot below shows the small view for a multiband compressor rendered:

![A screenshot of the graph editor for web synth with several nodes connected together.  A node labeled "Multi Compressor" is selected which has caused a small UI to be rendered on the right side of the page for controlling it.  The UI shows volume meters for three different frequency bands as well as several sliders for each for configuring the compressor for that band.](https://i.ameo.link/bsk.png)
