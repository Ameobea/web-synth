# midi-node

The **MIDI Node** is an internal part of web synth which handles sending and receiving MIDI events.  It isn't ever exposed to users or via the UI, but it plays a key role in MIDI processing within the application.

MIDI nodes work as both senders and receivers in the application.  They can be connected to each other as part of the [[patch-network]] in order to route MIDI events around.

MIDI nodes can be provided a set of callbacks when created that will be called when incoming MIDI events of different types are received by the node.  They also expose methods like `onAttack`, `onRelease`, etc. which can be used to send MIDI events to all connected destination MIDI nodes.

MIDI nodes also support sending messages to the audio thread for [[audio-thread-midi-scheduling]].
