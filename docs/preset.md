# preset

A **preset** is a piece of saved state for some component of the application, be it a [[module]], [[graph-editor]] node, or even a snapshot of the entire application.  Presets are designed to be shareable and loadable dynamically, and several components support this functionality already.

Here is a (partial) list of entities for which presets can be saved and loaded currently:
 * [[code-editor]]
 * [[synth-designer]]
 * [[looper]]
 * [[midi-editor]]
 * Full Application ([[composition-sharing]])

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[module]: module "web synth modules"
[graph-editor]: graph-editor "graph editor"
[code-editor]: code-editor "code-editor"
[synth-designer]: synth-designer "synth designer"
[looper]: looper "looper"
[midi-editor]: midi-editor "midi-editor"
[composition-sharing]: composition-sharing "composition-sharing"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
