![](https://ameo.link/u/9kh.png)

The **midi keyboard** is a web synth [[module]] and [[view-context]] which supports generating and routing MIDI events from either the computer keyboard, a virtual keyboard on the screen, or an external MIDI device via WebMIDI.  It exposes [[audio-connectables]] that can be routed using the [[graph-editor]] to control other modules.

The on-screen keyboard shown is created using [`react-piano`](https://github.com/kevinsqi/react-piano) as a base.  A version is also used in the [[fm-synth]] demo.
