# envelope generator

**Envelope Generators**, also known as **ADSRs**, are components that can be used to define how a value changes over time.  By dragging the different knobs, the level of the output over time can be set precisely.

Envelope generators are very versatile and can be used to modulate almost anything in web synth.  By default, ADSRs output values between 0 and 1.  Usually, you want values in a different range though.  In the [[graph-editor]], the [[scale-and-shift]] node can be used to convert outputs from 0 to 1 and whatever output range you'd like.  In the [[fm-synth]], the **output range** parameter can be used directly for this purpose:
