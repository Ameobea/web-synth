# vocal synthesis

There's a lot of stuff out there for vocal synthesis.  Much of it seems to be Japanese.  I'm focusing on musical aspects, the sure leader of which is Vocaloid.  However, Vocaloid is very much proprietary and entirely closed off.  However, there are alternatives:

- [[utau]]: Freeware similar to Vocaloid with lots of freely available soundbanks.  However, the quality is almost always far lower than that of the Vocaloids, especially modern ones.
- [[sinsy]]: Open source synthesizer that uses [[HTS]] under the hood
- [Open JTalk](http://open-jtalk.sourceforge.net/), a high-quality Japanese language speech synth that uses [[HTS]] under the hood
- [eCantorix](https://github.com/divVerent/ecantorix) which uses [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) under the hood (I know nothing about this but saw it mentioned in an UTAU discussion thread)

Then, there's a good amount of actual open-source stuff out there as well.  The most of it seems to be based off of [[HTS]], a speech synthesis system that uses Hiden Markov Models and Deep Neural Networks to synthesize audio. [[sinsy]] is an open source singing synth that builds on top of HTS to generate synthesized singing.  It's still under development very recently (as of Dec 2020 they released some significant new features).  Another popular one out there that builds on top of HTS is [[open-jtalk]] which is like Sinsy but targeted at speech rather than song.
