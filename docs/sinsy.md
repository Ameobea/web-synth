# sinsy

**Sinsy** is an open source singing engine for [[vocal-synthesis]] built on top of [[HTS]].  Website: <http://www.sinsy.jp/>  It takes two pieces of input: a [[musicxml]] file containing notes and lyrics/syllables to sing and a [[HTS]] voice file (*.htsvoice).

## wasm port

I spent some time trying to get this to run in the web browser via Emscripten + WebAssembly with much success.  Although at the time of writing this I've only just finished up an initial POC of generating a WAV file of singing voice from within the browser, the whole thing works end to end so any additional work is possible without limitation.
