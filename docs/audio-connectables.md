# audio-connectables

**Audio Connectables** are an internal entity used by the codebase to represent the inputs and outputs of a particular node in the [[patch-network]].

The code defining the interface for `AudioConnectables` can be found here: <https://github.com/Ameobea/web-synth/blob/bee9d29c9028eb390304c732299c022802f93995/src/patchNetwork/patchNetwork.ts#L38>

## port types

Each connectable input/output has one type:

 * audio (also referred to as `customAudio`)
 * data (also referred to as cv or number)
 * midi

With a few exceptions, connectable inputs/outputs can only be connected to corresponding outputs/inputs of the same type.
