# sleepwalking

**Sleepwalking** is the king of modern open-source vocal synthesis.  He founded the company Dreamtonics which builds the [[synthesizer-v]] software.  Earlier in his career, he built the moresampler used by the [[utau]] community; he's *the guy* when it comes to open source vocal synthesis.  He has a variety of open source libraries on [his Github](https://github.com/sleepwalking) for various vocal synthesis, DSP, and audio processing use cases.

He put out a TED talk thing ~5 years ago going over his initial journey learning vocal synthesis.  He talked about his initial experimentation in this space and some of his early projects which culminated in [[rocaloid]].  A few years after that, he created the initial release of [[synthesizer-v]] and eventually founded Dreamtonics.
