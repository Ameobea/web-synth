# view-context

A **view context** is the poorly-chosen name for one of the top-level [[module]]s of the web synth application.  It can be created as a standalone entity, renders independently to a view, and optionally exposes [[audio-connectables]] to allow it to be used as a part of the [[audio-graph]].

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[module]: module "web synth modules"
[audio-connectables]: audio-connectables "audio-connectables"
[audio-graph]: audio-graph "audio graph"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
