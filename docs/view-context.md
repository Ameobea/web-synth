# view-context

A **view context** (often abbreviated **vc** in web synth code) is the name for one of the top-level [[module]]s of the web synth application.  It can be created as a standalone entity, renders independently to a full-page view, and optionally exposes [[audio-connectables]] to allow it to be used as a part of the [[audio-graph]].

View contexts are listed at the top of the screen in the tabs:

These tabs can be re-ordered by dragging them.  You can rename tabs by double-clicking on them.  If you have more tabs than fit on the screen, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll through them.  (Also, consider using [[subgraph]]s to organize your nodes in that case.)

To add a view context to your composition, there are two methods:

* Click the + button on the right side of the screen and pick the view context you want from the list:

* Double-click the background of the [[graph-editor]], which will bring up a menu that can be used to add new nodes, including view contexts:
