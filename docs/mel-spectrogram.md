# mel-spectrogram

A **mel spectrogram** is a spectrogram that has a Y scale normalized to the _mel scale_.  The mel scale is basically how MIDI works; it's a logarithmic-based scale designed to linearize the percieved difference in pitches.

It is used by WaveGlow, a derivative of [[wavenet]], as an additional processing step to enhance the GAN.
