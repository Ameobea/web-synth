The **midi quantizer node** is a [[patch-network]] node in web synth that can be created via the [[graph-editor]].  It takes input signals in the range of [-1, 1] and outputs MIDI notes in a configurable range.  This node is useful for modular synth-esque patches and compositions and is one of the nodes that bridges between signals (CV) and MIDI events that are usable with modules such as the [[synth-designer]].

It can be usd as an arpeggiator if combined with a [[lfo-node]] as input.  It can also be interesting to use with a [[noise-generator-node]], especially when the output notes are set to a chord.
