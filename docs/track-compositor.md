# track-compositor

The **track compositor** is a not-yet-built [[module]] that serves as the main interface to using the application in a [[daw]]-like capacity.  Its purpose is to support combining multiple MIDI scores, modulation envelopes, and control sequences into a unified + synchronized interface for parallel playback.

More will be included here when the thing is actually built.
