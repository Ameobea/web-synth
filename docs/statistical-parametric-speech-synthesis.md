# statistical parametric speech synthesis

**Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis** is a type of [[vocal-synthesis]] that uses statistical modeling and/or machine learning to act as a [[tts]] engine.  This is an alternative approach to [[concatenative-synthesis]] which uses recordings of phonemes or small snippets of sound to produce speech.

The best overview of this that I've found online is here: <https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/ITSP/Statistical+parametric+speech+synthesis> archive link: <https://web.archive.org/web/20210312033816/https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/ITSP/Statistical+parametric+speech+synthesis>  It gives a truly excellent overview of the state of the art, detailed descriptions of various projects and how they work, and the benefits/drawbacks of different approaches.
