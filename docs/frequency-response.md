# frequency-response

**Frequency response** is a measurement of digital [[filter]]s' effects on signals that they process.  It measures the change in amplitude/loudness for each part of the frequency spectrum.  Filters usually subtract from signals, taking some harmonics out while letting others pass through.  However, filters can also attenuate/boost some parts of signals, which is what happens when you boost the q factor or use filter types such as lowshelf/highshelf/peaking filters.

Here's a plot from web synth's [[filter-designer]] [[module]] showing the aggregate frequency response of two composed biquad lowpass filters with different frequencies and q factors:
