# granular-synthesis

**Granular Synthesis** is a method of synthesis that uses small pieces of audio in the range of 10 milliseconds to 1 second or something like that to generate sound "textures", implement effects such as pitch-preserving speeding or slowing of audio, and other effects.  It is similar to [[concatenative-synthesis]], different in that [[concatenative-synthesis]] focuses on carefully connecting deliberately chosen samples in order to form very specific outputs such as [[speech-synthesis]], whereas granular synthesis often plays many overlapping "grains" which are sometimes chosen at random from different parts of a source sample.

## use in web synth

Web synth implements a granular synthesis module which supports specifying input samples, viewing their waveforms visually, selecting a chunk of the waveform, and then picking grains from that section and playing them back according to a variety of options.

The web synth granular synth is heavily based off of the [Clouds](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/) Eurorack module created by Mutable Instruments.  In fact, some of the mutable instruments [source code](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/clouds) was used to help structure the web synth implementation.
