# granular-synthesis

**Granular Synthesis** is a method of synthesis that uses small pieces of audio in the range of 10 milliseconds to 1 second or something like that to generate sound "textures", implement effects such as pitch-preserving speeding or slowing of audio, and other effects.  It is similar to [[concatenative-synthesis]], different in that [[concatenative-synthesis]] focuses on carefully connecting deliberately chosen samples in order to form very specific outputs such as [[speech-synthesis]], whereas granular synthesis often plays many overlapping "grains" which are sometimes chosen at random from different parts of a source sample.
