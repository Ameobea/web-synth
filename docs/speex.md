# speex

**Speex** is a now-obsolete audio codec designed for efficiently transmitting human voice.  It has support for some features like [[noise-suppression]] and echo cancellation built-in, apparently.

Speex is replaced by [[opus]] which is still widely in use.

The project was lead by [[jmvalin]].
