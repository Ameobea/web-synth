# FM Synthesizer

Web synth contains a fully fledged 8-operator polyphonic FM synthesizer with support for full modulation/automation of all parameters and inputs. It is integrated directly into the [[synth-designer]], and it is also available as a standalone demo that runs without the complexity of the full web synth platform: <https://synth.ameo.dev/fm.html>

## components

The FM synth consists of a few interconnected components that are each individually controllable:

* [[modulation-matrix]]
* [[effect-chain]]
* [[filter]]
