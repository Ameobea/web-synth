# hidden semi-markov model (hsmm)

A **hidden semi-markov model** or **hsmm** is a modified version of a hidden markov model (HMM) that, as far as I can tell, explicitly encodes durations for each of the states rather than including a loop to itself as one of the possible transitions.  It is used in [[statistical-parametric-speech-synthesis]], including that done with the [[hts]] framework, to generate speech features that are fed to a [[vocoder]] and synthesize speech.
