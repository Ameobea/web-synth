**GlowTTS** is a modern (research paper released April 2021) [[tts]] model. It has a unique architecture that allows for very fast [[vocal-synthesis]] and "an order-of-magnitude speed-up over the autoregressive model, [[tacotron-2]]. It's a machine learning-based approach and uses [[GAN]]s and [[mel-spectrogram]]s along with several other components in a rather complicated architecture to generate output waveforms.

"Additionally, we have shown that adjusting a GAN-based vocoder for the spectrograms predicted by the TTS model on the training dataset can significantly improve the similarity and speech quality for new speakers." (from website)

It's definitely state-of-the art stuff; compared to a lot of similar projects that I've seen, everything seems to be very well put together and packaged. It is used as the underlying [[vocal-synthesis]] engine of the [[larynx]] [[tts]] engine, and the results are impressive considering how easy it was to set up and how quickly the output speech is synthesized.
