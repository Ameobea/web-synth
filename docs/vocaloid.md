# vocaloid

**Vocaloid** is probably the most popular/well known singing [[vocal-synthesis]] software available.  Hatsune Miku is the iconic virtual singer that serves (served?) as their flagship voicebank.  It is non-free, but reguarly updated.  As of the time of writing this, there have been a total of 5 different releases.  There is language support for English, Japanese, Chinese, and others I'm sure.
