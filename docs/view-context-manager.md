# view-context-manager

The **view context manager** or **VCM** is the core of web synth which is responsible for creating + managing [[view-context]]s, the [[patch-network]], and other pieces of application functionality such as serialization/deserialization, saving + loading, and more.

The VCM's code is split between Rust code in the [[engine]] as well as TypeScript code that handles interfacing with the engine and linking the [[view-context]]s it renders.  This includes code that keeps the [[graph-editor]] up to date with the current state of the [[patch-network]], connecting + disconnecting [[module]]s as [[audio-connectables]] are updated live, and more.
