# cepstrum

Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepstrum

* Mangling of the word "spectrum"
* Computing it consists of 3 steps:
  * transform signal from time domain into frequency domain (FFT)
  * take logarithm of the spectrum yielded by FFT
  * transformation to [[quefrency]] domain

"Sometimes called the "spectrum of a spectrum""

"The cepstrum can be seen as information about the rate of change in the different spectrum bands"
