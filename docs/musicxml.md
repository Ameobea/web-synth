# MusicXML

**MusicXML** is a file format for specifying sheet music.  It can be used in a similar way to MIDI.  There are many available programs for generating it, and the spec is widely used, highly documentated, and mature.

There are many programs available for reading/writing MusicXML:

* Finale Notepad (I used this like 10 years ago but apparently it's still around)
* Cadencii, popular in the [[utau]] community for producing input for [[vocal-synthesis]] programs like [[sinsy]]: <http://utaforum.net/threads/cadencii-download.2429/>

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[utau]: utau "UTAU"
[vocal-synthesis]: vocal-synthesis "vocal synthesis"
[sinsy]: sinsy "sinsy"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
