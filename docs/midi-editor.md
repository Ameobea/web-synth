# midi-editor

The **MIDI Editor** allows the editing of MIDI data visually to create music.  It is the primary way that songs are written using web synth.

The current MIDI editor was the first piece of web synth that was built, and it is in very bad shape.  It is functional in a very small sense, but integrates with the rest of the the [[patch-network]] cleanly.  In addition to inputting notes, it also supports playback, looping, and recording from MIDI inputs.

I am in the process of building a new MIDI editor from scratch; see [[2021-03-20]] for the initial design document and some thoughts on its implementation.
