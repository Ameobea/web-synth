TODO: Add image of code editor

The **code editor** is a web synth [[module]] that allows users to write their own code or load code written by others that is then dynamically compiled and loaded into the [[audio-graph]].  It currently supports two programming languages: [[faust]] and [[soul]].

In addition to allowing users to edit + compile code, the code editor handles detecting configurable parameters for the program and both automatically generating a simple UI with sliders, buttons, etc. for configuring those parameters directly as well as creating and exposing [[audio-connectables]] so that they can be modulated via the [[patch-network]].
