# effect chain

![](https://ameo.link/u/8ph.png)

The [[fm-synth]]'s **effect chain** provides an interface to configure the effects that are applied to the output of the FM synth or to individual [[operator]]s.  Effects are applied from top to bottom with the output from each getting passed into the next.

Effects in the effect chain are applied separately for each [[voice]] in the [[fm-synth]].  If any of their parameters are controlled by [[envelope-generator]]s, then each of those envelopes will be triggered independently for each voice.
