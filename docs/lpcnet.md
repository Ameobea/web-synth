# LPCNet

**LPCNet** is a WIP [[vocal-synthesis]] system from Mozilla.  From their Github README, "Work in progress software for researching low CPU complexity algorithms for speech synthesis and compression by applying Linear Prediction techniques to [[WaveRNN]]".  "This software is an open source starting point for LPCNet/WaveRNN-based speech synthesis and coding."

Github repo: <https://github.com/mozilla/LPCNet>

The lead contributor seems to be [[jmvalin]].  It shares some code with [[opus]], and he has a research paper detailing how he integrated it with Opus itself to provide efficient low-bitrate transmission of speech: <https://jmvalin.ca/papers/opusnet.pdf>
