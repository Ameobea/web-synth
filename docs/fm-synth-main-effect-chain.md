# main effect chain

The **main effect chain** is a series of effects thare applied to the output from the FM synthesizer.  The chain exists between the output of each of the [[operator]]s from the [[modulation-matrix]] and occurs before audio is processed by the [[filter]] (if enabled).

Effects are applied in series, one after another, with the output from effect 1 being passed to effect 2 etc.
