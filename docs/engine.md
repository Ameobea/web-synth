# engine

**engine** refers to the WebAssembly code that is loaded as a part of web synth.  The `engine` subdirectory in the project root contains all Rust code used by the project.

Inside the `engine` directory, there is an additional `engine` directory (`engine/engine`) which contains code that controls the [[view-context-manager]] and other core pieces of the application.
