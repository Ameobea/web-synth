MAIN GOAL: Zone-in and planning for [[midi-editor]] copy/paste

OK, so MIDI recording is built and it seems to be working well.  On to the next feature!  And that happens to be copy/paste.

I think this one is going to be a cinch and I'll probably come back here to plan the next feature.  What we want to do is take all selected notes and record their positions and line numbers relative to the start of the earliest note when the copy button is pressed.  Then, when we paste, we take the cursor position and treat it as the start point and paste all of the notes in.  After we paste, we change the selection to the set of all notes that were just pasted.  The only thing we really have to do is figure out how to handle note conflicts.  I like the idea of just not pasting notes that have conflicts but continuing with the paste for ones that do.  I don't see much downside; if the user wants to undo, they can just hit delete since the selection will be changed to the set of all just-pasted notes.

When we paste, we need to move the cursor to largest end point of all notes that were just pasted to facilitate pasting the same selection multiple times in a row.

And... I think that's it!  I don't think that there's anything else that needs to be done for this.  Let's knock it out.

Oh one thing I just thought of is that we'll probably want to add a "cut" as well as "copy" but that's literally just "copy + delete" so no problem there.
