# audio graph

The **audio graph** is the backbone of the web synth platform.  At its core, web synth consists of a network of nodes or modules that either produce, process, or accept streaming audio or MIDI.  These nodes are connected together in user-defined ways to produce sound and respond to user input.  Since web synth is built on top of [[web-audio]], this closely models `WebAudio`'s own audio graph.

## viewing + interfacing with the audio graph

The main interface to the audio graph is the [[graph-editor]].  It provides a full view of the audio graph, all its nodes, and the connections between them.  It also allows nodes to be created/deleted and for nodes to be dis/connected in arbitrary ways.
