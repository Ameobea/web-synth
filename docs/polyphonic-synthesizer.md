# polyphonic synthesizer

A **polyphonic synthesizer** is a synthesizer that can play multiple different notes at the same time.  In web synth, the [[synth-designer]] and all of its supported synthesizers are polyphonic along with the [[fm-synth]] demo.

Web synth currently has 10 [[voice]]s for each of its synthesizers, meaning that a total of 10 notes can be playing at the same time.
