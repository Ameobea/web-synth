MAIN GOAL: Plan out order of work for [[sample-editor]], figure out how to get started with this.

I think the first question to answer is what does an MVP of this look like?

 - Allow users to drag in samples from the sample library into the MIDI editor and place them on note lines
 - Full + accurate playback for the placed samples
 - Customized note box rendering for samples showing the name of the sample
 - Handling for BPM wrt. the actual lengths of samples, accurately handling collissions

I feel like I'm brushing over a lot of hidden complexity here, but if that were to be achieved I'd be happy enough to consider it a functional MVP.

Next-tier features that I'd like to see are:

 - Sample recording + export
   - Integration into patch network as a top level sample recorder node
   - Export capabilities
 - More detailed sample note box rendering with rendered waveform
 - Sample crossfade editor
 - Sample transformations and effects (reversing, etc.), derived samples persistence and association
