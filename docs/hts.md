# HTS

**HTS** is an open source [[vocal synthesis]] framework that forms the basis of several other higher-level open source speech synthesis tools including [[sinsy]] and [[open-jtalk]].  Website: <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>

At its core, there are voice models ([[htsvoice]] files) which are generated by training on tagged audio.  A speaker speaks a bunch of things, those things are tagged with words, n-grams, or some other stuff, and then a model is built using that training.  The resulting model can then be loaded by HTS and used to generate waveforms based on arbitrary text input.

There is a C library that handles much of the heavy lifting involved with loading HTS voice models: <https://github.com/Ameobea/hts_engine_API>  It is used + imported directly by [[sinsy]].

It seems that it's been around for a long time and that there's been a lot of research and grants and stuff going into it; it's very mature, apparently.
