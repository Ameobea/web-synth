# bitcrusher

A **bitcrusher** is an audio effect that consists of two parts: sample rate reducer and bit depth reducer, which is sometimes known as a *decimator*.  Depending on how extreme each of the two parts are applied and if/how they are modulated, the effects can range from creating lofi/retro sounds or extreme distortion and artifacts.

## aliasing

A side effect of sample rate reduction is [[aliasing]] which can be quite severe.  It can be counteracted, and many bitcrushers include a built-in low-pass [[filter]] to handle this.
