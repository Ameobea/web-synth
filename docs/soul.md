# soul

**Soul** is a programming language specialized for digital signal processing.  It supports creating audio effects, synthesizers, and other things and compiles to a variety of targets including WebAssembly.  It is a new language that just hit 1.0 a couple of weeks ago. It is a fresh take on the same problem space, but it has a simpler syntax compared to [[faust]] and seems targeted at devs that are familiar with C++ or Java.  It is integrated directly into the [[code-editor]] so that Soul code can be written, compiled, and loaded into the [[audio-graph]] all from the web synth interface.
