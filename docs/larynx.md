# larynx

**larynx** is an open source, fully-functional end-to-end [[tts]] solution.  It builds on several other [[vocal-synthesis]] and [[tts]] libraries and toolkits to make speech synthesis extremely easy via an API as well as a simple web interface.  Getting it running on my computer required a single command, and it launched a docker container which started up the API and made over 50 pre-trained voices available.  They sound quite good, and synthesis was extremely fast.

If I were looking for a practical, high-quality, easy-to-use, functional TTS engine, this is the one I'd go for.

Their readme says that it's built using [[grutt]], a "tokenizer, text cleaner, and IPA phonemizer for several human lanauges" as well as [[onnx]] which stands for "Open Neural Network Exchange" and seems to be some kind of serialization format for [[neural network]]/deep learning models.  It uses [[glowtts]] to perform the actual synthesis.  HiFi-GAN ([[GAN]]) is used as a [[vocoder]].

Architecture diagram from their readme:

"Voices are trained on [[phoneme]] ids and [[mel-spectrogram]]"

It seems to support voices from [[glowtts]]; the web interface allows for downloading different voices and apparently [[vocoder]]s as well (maybe those are the same thing?).
