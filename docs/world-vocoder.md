"WORLD is free software for high-quality speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis. It can estimate Fundamental frequency (F0) ([[fundamental-frequency-estimation]]), aperiodicity and spectral envelope and also generate the speech like input speech with only estimated parameters." - from the Github repo

It is a [[vocoder]] that is designed for integration into [[statistical-parametric-speech-synthesis]] systems.

License: modified BSD

It splits input speech into three components:
* [[fundamental-frequency-estimation]] (F0) based on DIO (Distributed Inline-filter Operation) or Harvest
* [[spectral-envelope]] estimation using [[cheaptrick]]
* [[aperiodicity]]

As I understand it, the [[spectral-envelope]] is the actual vocal quality that we're trying to capture + model.  It consists of the different harmonics that make up the intonations of each of the pieces of speech.

## wasm port

There is a JavaScript API version available via Emscripten/WebAssembly: [World.JS](https://github.com/YuzukiTsuru/World.JS)

Example code with psuedo-notebook style: <https://www.gloomyghost.com/World.JS/#/?id=synthesis_js> <- this is quite good and could be a great starting point for experimentation with this
