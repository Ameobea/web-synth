# web synth docs

Web synth is a browser-based [[daw]] and audio synthesis platform.

**Try it now at <https://synth.ameo.dev/>**

It's 100% free and [open source](https://github.com/ameobea/web-synth). It's built on the WebAudio API and makes heavy use of modern web features like WebAssembly, `AudioWorkletProcessor` and `SharedArrayBuffer` for things like implementing custom digital signal processing code and generating realtime visualizations.

It shares similarities with other tools like Bitwig Grid and audio programming environments like Pure Data, but it also has most of the features you'd expect from a traditional DAW like a [[midi-editor]], [[sample-library]], [[signal-analyzer]], and several built in synths and effects.
