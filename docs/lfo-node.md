# lfo-node

The **lfo node** is a [[patch-network]] node in web synth that can be created via the [[graph-editor]].  LFO stands for low-frequency oscillator, and that's just what it does.  It outputs values in the range of [-1, 1] in various selectable patterns.  It is useful for varying params of different [[module]]s.
