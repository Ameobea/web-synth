The full web synth is available online with no installation or other setup required: <https://synth.ameo.dev/>  However, the full version is not yet finished and may be very difficult to use due to a lack of features, polish, and documentation.

There is a standalone [[fm-synth]] demo available which is the easiest way to explore the capabilities of browser-based audio synthesis: <https://synth.ameo.dev/fm.html>
